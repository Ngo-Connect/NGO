NGO-Connect is a comprehensive, web-based donation management portal engineered to effectively bridge the operational gaps between donors, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and beneficiaries. By establishing a secure, automated, and transparent digital ecosystem, the platform mitigates the systemic inefficiencies and accountability deficits inherent in traditional manual record-keeping. The solution leverages a robust three-tier architecture to optimize critical workflows, including secure user registration, precise fund allocation, and real-time resource tracking. Facilitating seamless collaboration through four distinct user roles, the system empowers NGOs to organize impactful events while providing donors with granular visibility into fund utilization via advanced data-driven analytics. Prioritizing future-proof scalability and code efficiency through a modular design, NGO-Connect delivers a high-integrity framework that modernizes professional social welfare delivery.
